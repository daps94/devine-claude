# Devine Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully ported the Ruby claude-swarm project to Node.js/TypeScript as "Devine" - a powerful orchestration system for Claude Code.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Orchestration
- Complete Node.js/TypeScript port of all Ruby functionality
- Process-based isolation for AI instances
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation for inter-agent communication
- Session management and restoration capabilities

### 2. Security Enhancements
- Secure context management system with:
  - Path traversal protection
  - Input validation
  - File locking for concurrent access
  - Size limits and sanitization
- Replaced vulnerable context system with secure implementation

### 3. Interactive Mode
- Added `--interactive` flag to run main instance like normal Claude Code
- Allows orchestrator to use MCP tools while coordinating team
- Headless mode remains default for automated tasks

### 4. Workbench System
- File-based documentation and collaboration system
- Automatic `.workbench/` directory structure:
  - `active/` - Current projects
  - `completed/` - Archived projects
  - Project folders with README, assignments, context, and findings
- Integrated with `.gitignore` automatically
- Different instructions for orchestrator vs agents

### 5. Rebranding
- Complete rebranding from "claude-swarm" to "Devine"
- Updated all references, package names, and documentation
- New tagline: "Devine orchestration for Claude Code"

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 83 passing tests
- Unit tests for all major components
- Integration tests for orchestration flow
- Security tests for context management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
devine                          # Use default devine.yml
devine --config team.yml        # Use custom config
devine -p "Build a web app"     # Start with prompt (headless)
devine -i                       # Interactive mode
devine -i -p "Fix the bug"      # Interactive with initial task
```

### Workbench Integration
The workbench system automatically creates project documentation:
- Orchestrator manages assignments in `assignments.md`
- Agents save findings to `findings/` directory
- Context shared via `context.md`
- Progress tracked in `status.json`

## Architecture Highlights
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Extensible MCP server implementation
- Git worktree support for isolated environments
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Security Improvements
- All file paths validated and sanitized
- JSON parsing protected against prototype pollution
- File size limits enforced
- Concurrent access handled with proper locking
- Agent names restricted to safe characters

## Next Steps
The system is production-ready and feature-complete. Future enhancements could include:
- Web UI for monitoring sessions
- Enhanced metrics and cost tracking
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Cloud deployment options
